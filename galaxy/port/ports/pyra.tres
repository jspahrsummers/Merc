description = "Pyra is a scorched world of fire and stone. Its surface is a vast expanse of blackened rock and flowing lava, punctuated by towering volcanoes that perpetually belch ash and sulfurous gases into the thin atmosphere.

Despite its inhospitable nature, Pyra hosts a small but resilient colony of miners and researchers. They live in heavily shielded habitats, venturing out only in protective suits to harvest rare minerals formed in the planet's extreme conditions.

The spaceport, a stark structure of heat-resistant alloys, clings to a rare stable plateau. Its primary feature is a bustling bar, the \"Obsidian Oasis,\" where visitors and locals alike seek respite from the oppressive heat. The bar's viewport offers a mesmerizing view of rivers of molten rock snaking across the charred landscape.

Beyond the spaceport and a few scattered outposts, Pyra remains largely untamed. Its barren expanses discourage extensive facility development, making each structure a triumph of engineering against the planet's fiery will."

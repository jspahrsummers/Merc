description = "As your ship pierces through Novus's thin atmosphere, a world of stark beauty unfolds beneath you. Vast plains of ice stretch to the horizon, their surfaces reflecting the distant blue-white glare of Nova Lumina's star in a dazzling display. The sky above is a deep, almost black purple, with wispy clouds of nitrogen and methane drifting lazily across its expanse.

The main settlement, Frosthold, appears as a cluster of sleek, dome-like structures nestled in a valley between towering ice cliffs. As you approach the landing pad, you notice the occasional burst of steam and gas from nearby geysers, evidence of the planet's hidden geothermal activity.

Disembarking, the biting cold immediately seeps through your thermal suit. The air is thin and crisp, with a faint methane odor. Around you, hardy colonists go about their business, their sturdy exo-suits a testament to Novus's unforgiving environment.

The small spaceport bustles with activity. Traders load crates of rare ice-bound minerals and exotic frozen gases, while scientists huddle over readouts from deep-core drills. In the distance, through reinforced viewports, you can see teams of explorers setting out across the icy wastes, searching for new resources or traces of ancient, frozen life."

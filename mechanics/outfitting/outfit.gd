class_name Outfit

## Represents a ship outfit or component that can be installed on a ship.
##
## For game balance, the number of outfits that can be installed on any given ship can be limited in a variety of ways:
## - Weapons are limited by the number of weapon mounts (hardpoints) available.
## - Outfits add to a ship's mass, reducing its ability to accelerate and manuever.
## - Outfits may require power, which is limited by the ship's battery.

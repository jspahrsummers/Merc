# Development scripts

This directory contains scripts that are useful for development and testing of the project.

To use, set up a Python virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then run scripts as usual with Python:

```sh
python dev_scripts/some_script.py
```

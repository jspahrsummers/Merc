# Development scripts

This directory contains scripts that are useful for development and testing of the project.

To use, set up a Python virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then invoke scripts directly, from the repository root:

```sh
./dev_scripts/claude.py
```
